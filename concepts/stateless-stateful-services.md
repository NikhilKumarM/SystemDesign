# Stateless Vs Stateful Services

Having worked on both stateless and stateful services, one thing I have learned is:

👉 Stateful services should be chosen ONLY when statefullness is absolutely necessary — otherwise, stateless is the way to go!
 
Why?

Stateless services are easier to scale, replicate, and recover from failures.
Stateful services, while powerful, come with added complexity — session management, fault tolerance, and consistency challenges.
 
⚙️ So when should we really go for stateful design?

When you need persistent client state (e.g., chat apps, gaming sessions, transactions).
When session continuity is critical for user experience.

✅ But in most cases, if you don't truly need to maintain state, stateless design keeps your system lean and scalable.
 
🚀 Key takeaway:

"Go Stateless by default. Go Stateful only when you must."
