# Redundancy vs Replication ðŸ’¾

Ever wonder how Netflix keeps streaming even when servers crash? Or how your bank ensures your balance stays accurate across all branches?

It comes down to two critical reliability strategies:

ðŸš¨ Redundancy: Your Emergency Backup
Think of redundancy like carrying a spare tire in your car. It sits unused until your main tire fails â€“ then it saves the day. 
- A backup system waits on standby
- It's identical to the primary system
- It only activates when the primary fails

ðŸ”„ Replication: Your Multiple Copies
Replication is like having the same book in multiple libraries. If one burns down, the book still exists elsewhere. 
- Multiple active copies exist simultaneously
- Changes sync across all copies
- All copies can serve users at once

Why This Matters ðŸ‘‡
When building resilient systems, choosing the right strategy can be the difference between:
- 99.9% uptime (9 hours of downtime per year)
- 99.999% uptime (just 5 minutes of downtime per year)

The simple question to ask: Do you need a standby backup (redundancy) or multiple active copies (replication)?

Often, the best systems use both: replication for normal operations and redundancy for catastrophic and unanticipated failures.
